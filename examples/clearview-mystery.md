# Clearview Mystery

A strange light at the old lighthouse. Whispers of missing people. My best friend's sister vanished three days ago. The police say she ran away. I don't believe them.

## Session 1
*Date: 2025-09-03 | Duration: 1h30 | Scenes: S1-S3*

**Recap:** First session. Alex begins investigating Sarah's disappearance.

**Goals:** Establish the mystery, find first clue, introduce the lighthouse location.

### S1 *School library after hours*

```
> Sneak inside to check the archives for info about the lighthouse
d: Stealth d6=5 vs TN 4 => Success
=> I slip through the side door. The library is dark and quiet. [L:Library|dark|dusty|forbidden]

? Is there anyone else here?
-> No, but... (d6=3)
=> I hear footsteps in the distance. The janitor making rounds. [N:Mr. Chen|tired|suspicious|janitor]

> Search the archives for lighthouse records
d: Investigation d6=6 vs TN 4 => Success
=> Jackpot! I find a folder marked "Clearview Lighthouse - Condemned 1985"

tbl: d100=42 => "Torn diary page"
=> A yellowed page falls out. The handwriting is shaky: "The light calls to us. We must not answer. - M.W. 1985"

[Thread:Lighthouse Mystery|Open]
[Clock:Investigation 1/6]
```

The paper is old, almost brittle. Who was M.W.? And what did they mean about "the light"?

```
? Do I hear the janitor getting closer?
-> Yes, and... (d6=6)
=> Not just footsteps now—keys jangling. He's checking this floor!

> Hide behind the shelves and wait for him to pass
d: Stealth d6=4 vs TN 5 => Fail
=> A book tumbles from my bag. THUD.

N (Mr. Chen): "Who's there? Library's closed!"

> Stay absolutely still, hope he doesn't check thoroughly
d: Luck d6=5 vs TN 5 => Success
=> He shine his flashlight around but doesn't come closer
=> "Probably rats," he mutters and moves on

[PC:Alex|Stress+1]
```

That was too close. I wait five minutes, then slip out through the window.

### S2 *Alex's room, midnight*

```
? Do I have any family connections to the lighthouse?
-> Yes, but... (d6=4)
=> Looking through old photos, I find Mom at the lighthouse! But she never mentioned it.

(note: Establishing mystery connection to PC)
```

I find a photo from 1990. Mom's standing in front of the lighthouse, maybe 18 years old. On the back: "Last visit - never again."

```
[Thread:Mom's Connection|Open]
[Clock:Investigation 2/6]
```

### S3 *Path to the old lighthouse, next morning*

```
> Bike to the lighthouse to investigate
d: Athletics d6=4 vs TN 4 => Success
=> The ride takes 20 minutes. The lighthouse looms ahead, silhouetted against gray clouds. [L:Lighthouse|ruined|isolated|eerie]

? Are there any signs of recent activity?
-> Yes, and... (d6=5)
=> Fresh tire tracks in the dirt! Someone's been here recently.

> Approach quietly and look for an entrance
d: Stealth d6=2 vs TN 4 => Fail
=> I step on broken glass. CRUNCH. [Clock:Suspicion 1/6]

? Does anyone respond from inside?
-> No, but... (d6=3)
=> A light flickers briefly in the tower window, then goes dark
```

My heart pounds. Did I imagine that? The lighthouse has been abandoned for 40 years—there shouldn't be power.

```
> Search around the base for entrances
d: Investigation d6=5 vs TN 4 => Success
=> The main door is boarded up tight, but I find a basement window partially open

> Climb through the basement window
d: Athletics d6=6 vs TN 4 => Success
=> I squeeze through. The basement is pitch black and smells of salt and decay.

[PC:Alex|HP 8|Stress 2|Gear:Flashlight,Notebook]
```

I click on my flashlight. The beam cuts through the darkness, revealing...

```
> Search the basement for clues
d: Investigation d6=6 vs TN 5 => Strong Success
=> Fresh footprints in the dust leading to stairs! And something else...

tbl: d100=67 => "Personal belonging"
=> A dropped phone! Recent model. Locked screen shows missed calls from "Dad - Please call"

[Thread:Whose Phone?|Open]
[Clock:Investigation 3/6]
```

This is recent. Very recent. Someone was here in the last day or two.

```
? Do I hear any sounds from upstairs?
-> Yes, but... (d6=4)
=> Footsteps above. Slow. Deliberate. But they stop when I freeze.

(note: Building tension, introducing antagonist presence)
```

I hold my breath. The footsteps resume, moving away. Whoever is up there doesn't know I'm here. Yet.

```
> Follow the footprints upstairs carefully
d: Stealth d6=3 vs TN 5 => Fail
=> The stairs creak loudly under my weight

[Clock:Suspicion 3/6]

? Do the footsteps react?
-> Yes, and... (d6=6)
=> They stop. Then start moving quickly toward the stairwell!

> Run back to the basement window
d: Athletics d6=5 vs TN 4 => Success
=> I sprint back down, dive through the window

N (Voice from above): "Wait! I saw you! I know who you are!"

> Get on my bike and ride away fast
d: Athletics d6=6 vs TN 5 => Success
=> I pedal like my life depends on it. Behind me, a figure emerges from the lighthouse—I can't make out who.

**Session 1 End**

**What we learned:**
- The lighthouse has recent activity
- Someone (M.W.) warned about "the light" in 1985
- Mom has a mysterious connection to this place
- Someone else is at the lighthouse—are they friend or foe?

---

## Session 2
*Date: 2025-09-10 | Duration: 2h | Scenes: S4-S7*

**Recap:** Alex found evidence of recent activity at the lighthouse and was chased away by an unknown person. Stress is building.

**Goals:** Identify the mysterious person, find Sarah's connection, uncover more about the lighthouse's history.

### S4 *Coffee shop, afternoon*

```
> Research the phone I found (took photo of lock screen before leaving it)
d: Technology d6=5 vs TN 4 => Success
=> The wallpaper is custom—a band logo. I recognize it: Sarah listened to them!

[Clock:Investigation 5/6]

? Was the phone Sarah's?
-> Yes, and... (d6=5)
=> Sarah's friend Jenna texts me: "OMG is that Sarah's phone?? Where did you find it??"

(note: Connecting threads - Sarah was at the lighthouse)
```

I meet Jenna at the coffee shop. She's shaking.

```
N (Jenna): "Sarah went to the lighthouse three days ago. She said she had to 'answer the call.' I thought she was being dramatic." [N:Jenna|worried|scared|Sarah's friend]

> Ask Jenna if Sarah mentioned anything else
d: Empathy d6=6 vs TN 5 => Success
=> Jenna breaks down. "There were others too. Mark from school. Lisa from the debate team. They all said the same thing about 'the call.'"

[Thread:The Calling|Open]
[N:Mark|missing]
[N:Lisa|missing]
```

Three missing teens. All went to the lighthouse. All mentioned "the call."

```
? Does Jenna know anything about my mom's connection?
-> No, but... (d6=3)
=> She doesn't know about my mom, but her grandmother used to work at the lighthouse before it closed
```

### S5 *Jenna's grandmother's house, evening*

```
> Interview Jenna's grandmother about the lighthouse
[N:Mrs. Patterson|elderly|former lighthouse keeper|knows secrets]

N (Mrs. Patterson): "You shouldn't go there, child. Especially not now."

> Press her for information about 1985
d: Persuasion d6=5 vs TN 5 => Success
=> She sighs heavily. "1985. That was when Michael Warren died. He was the keeper. Found him at the base of the tower. But before he died, he destroyed the light. Said it was calling to people, making them jump."

[N:Michael Warren|deceased|1985|warning]
[Thread:The Light's Curse|Open]
```

Michael Warren. M.W. from the diary page!

```
? Does Mrs. Patterson know about my mom?
-> Yes, and... (d6=6)
=> "Your mother was here that summer. She was one of the ones it called. But Michael... he saved her. Destroyed the light before she could... before it was too late."

=> Tears stream down Mrs. Patterson's face. "But now it's back. The light is back. And it's hungry."

[Clock:Investigation 6/6] => Complete!
[Thread:Save Sarah|Open]
[Track:Understanding the Curse 3/8]
```

The pieces click together. The lighthouse calls to people. Mom was called. Sarah was called. And whoever was at the lighthouse... maybe they're trying to stop it too?

### S6 *Back at the lighthouse, dusk*

```
> Return to the lighthouse to find Sarah
d: Courage d6=5 vs TN 6 => Partial Success
=> I make it back, but my hands are shaking. [PC:Alex|Stress 4]

? Is the mysterious person still there?
-> Yes, but... (d6=4)
=> I see a silhouette in the tower window. They're watching for something.

> Call out to identify myself
> "I'm Alex! I'm trying to help! Are you looking for the missing people too?"

? Do they respond positively?
-> Yes (d6=6)
=> A rope ladder drops from the window

N (Voice): "Climb up! Quickly! Before it starts again!"
```

I climb the swaying ladder, arms burning. At the top, a figure pulls me inside.

```
> Get a good look at who this is
```

It's a young man, maybe 25, with wild eyes and days-old stubble. [N:David|determined|obsessed|former engineer]

```
N (David): "I'm David. I worked on the cell tower project near here. When they installed it three months ago... the lighthouse started calling again. The electromagnetic field, it... activates something in the old light mechanism."

[Thread:Modern Technology Trigger|Open]
[Track:Understanding the Curse 5/8]

> Ask David if he's seen Sarah
? Is Sarah here?
-> Yes, but... (d6=4)
=> David points to a door. "She's up in the light room. But Alex... she doesn't want to leave. None of them do. They're waiting for the light to turn on."

[Clock:Light Activation 2/6]
```

### S7 *Lighthouse tower room, night falling*

```
> Climb to the light room to confront Sarah
d: Athletics d6=6 vs TN 4 => Success
=> The spiral stairs seem endless, but I reach the top

[L:Light Room|glass walls|intact lens|hypnotic]
```

Sarah stands at the window, staring at the sea. Two others with her—Mark and Lisa. All three turn to look at me with glassy eyes.

```
N (Sarah): "Alex. You heard it too. You came." [N:Sarah|entranced|missing|must save]

> Try to snap Sarah out of it
d: Empathy d6=4 vs TN 6 => Fail
=> She just smiles. "It's beautiful, Alex. When the light turns on, we'll finally understand."

[PC:Alex|Stress 5]

? Is the light mechanism starting to activate?
-> Yes, and... (d6=5)
=> The old lens begins to hum. Dim light flickers inside it. The cell tower's signal is charging it!

[Clock:Light Activation 4/6]

> Look for a way to disable the light
d: Investigation d6=6 vs TN 5 => Success
=> I spot the main power coupling—same setup David showed me. If I can disconnect the electromagnetic field...

(David climbs up behind me)

N (David): "We have to break the lens! It's the only way!"

> Make a choice: trust David and break the lens, or try a gentler approach
```

(note: Critical decision point)

```
> Try to break the coupling connection first (less destructive)
d: Technology d6=5 vs TN 6 => Partial Success
=> I manage to loosen it, but the lens is still charging. Not enough time!

[Clock:Light Activation 5/6]

> Grab a metal rod and smash the lens
d: Athletics d6=6 vs TN 5 => Success
=> CRASH! The lens shatters into a thousand pieces. The humming stops instantly.

[Track:Understanding the Curse 8/8] => Complete!
```

The three teens collapse, gasping. Sarah blinks, confused.

```
N (Sarah): "Alex? What... where am I?"

[Thread:The Calling|Closed]
[Thread:Save Sarah|Closed]
[Clock:Light Activation|Destroyed]
```

We sit on the light room floor as dawn breaks. Sarah, Mark, and Lisa remember nothing of the last three days. David and I exchange a look—we know this isn't over. The cell tower is still there. The mechanism, though broken, could be rebuilt.

```
[Thread:Prevent Future Activations|Open]
[Track:Permanent Solution 0/10]
```

But for now, everyone is safe.
